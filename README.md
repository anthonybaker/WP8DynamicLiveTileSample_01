WP8DynamicLiveTileSample_01
===========================

A simple and short sample project demonstrating how to create the application's Live Tile using one of the available templates, with the difference that the Live Tile uses images loaded dynamically from the application's Isolated Storage, instead of using embedded images. This approach allows the Live Tile's images to be updated later one, and avoid having them embedded into the application itself.
